# Job Portal Website Template

This is a **static Job Portal website template** built using **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**.  
I created this project as part of my learning practice to improve my frontend development skills and UI design understanding.

The template includes multiple pages commonly used in job portals such as job listings, job details, user profiles, and more.
